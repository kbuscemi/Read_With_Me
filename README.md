### The Story Behind this Website

---

My inspiration for buidling this website came from my love of reading. Ever since I was little I would always have a book in my hand and to this day
I am constantly reading. With all the various genres out there my favorite is most definitely non-fiction - I find biographies to be extremely fascinating.
I would be lying if I said I wasn't a part of a few book clubs as recommending new books is part of the fun. And that's what sparked the idea of designing
Read With Me. I wanted to build a full stack app where users could create multiple reading lists and add asmany books as they would like to each one. 
My goal is for the user to be able to find new books to read and to ultimately recommend books to their friends and family. While building this app I decided 
to include books that I have read over the years and these are books I recommend if you haven't read them already. I hope you enjoy!!

### Technologies
I used the following technologies to build this full stack app:
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

Before building my app I devised a wireframe, userstories, and an ERD which can be found on my Trello board.

**Unsolved Problems**
Ideally I would like to have the "add" button for when adding books to a user's storyboard to be aligned regardless of the length of the storyboard title.

**Future Features**
- To have a comment box for users to leave a comment on whether they enjoyed the book or not
- I would like to add a feature where a user can recommend a book to another user
- I would like to add a section informing users where they can purchase the books
